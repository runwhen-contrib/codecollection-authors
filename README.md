[Public] RunWhen CodeCollection Authors

This repo is for tracking collaborative opensource work across the community on codebundles & codecollections. Please check the Issues tab for code bundle requests.

To get started on authoring your own codebundles, see our [public docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/code-collection-development/getting-started-with-codecollection-development)

This repo is not for version-controlling code, just managing codebundle work in the Issues tab.
